# App Flow Document for PRP Hair Treatment Candidacy Quiz Web App

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A new visitor arrives at the PRP Hair Window Finder by clicking a link from an advertisement, social media post, or through organic search and lands on the public quiz homepage. This landing page features a friendly hero section with a clear headline explaining that this is a 60-second beauty quiz rather than a medical intake form. The visitor is invited to start the quiz by clicking a prominent “Start Quiz” button. There is no user account creation required for quiz participants. Instead, at the very end of the quiz, the system prompts for an email address, phone number, and consent checkbox to receive personalized results and follow-up information. No password or traditional sign-up flow is needed for participants.

Administrators and content managers access a separate sign-in page protected by email and password authentication. On this page, admins can enter their credentials or click a link to recover a forgotten password. Once authenticated, they are redirected to the admin dashboard where they manage quiz logic, media assets, and analytics. If an administrator loses their password, they use the standard password recovery flow to request a reset link, set a new password, and regain access.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
When a general visitor arrives without signing in, they see the public home page that doubles as the quiz entry point. This page displays a brief introduction, an animated progress bar graphic hinting at the seven-step journey ahead, reassuring copy about privacy and purpose, and a single “Start Quiz” button at the bottom of the viewport. Scrolling down further provides more context, imagery, and testimonials that build trust before the visitor commits to the quiz.

For administrators, after they complete the sign-in process, they land on an admin dashboard. This dashboard shows a left-hand navigation menu with links to the logic editor, media library, analytics panel, and integration settings. The main area displays an overview of quiz performance metrics, including completion rate, drop-off points, and lead volume. From this view, the admin can navigate to any section of the back-end without leaving the dashboard.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the visitor clicks “Start Quiz,” the app overlays a full-screen onboarding panel that explains what the quiz will and will not cover. A consent checkbox lets users agree to receive follow-up contact. Tapping “Let’s Go” animates the progress bar filling with hair-strand graphics and advances to the first quiz question.

The quiz unfolds across seven sequential screens. The first three screens present image-based selectors or GIFs for condition type and onset timing. Users tap the image that best fits their experience. Screens four and five each include an autoplay explainer video under eight seconds and a contextual slider for more nuanced input. On screen six, users choose an emotional goal by tapping avatar-style thumbnails with minimal text. The seventh screen invites a short free-text reflection on how hair loss is affecting them emotionally. At every step, the progress bar and optional “Skip” link are visible.

When the visitor completes the seventh question, the interface transitions to a data capture screen. Here the user enters their email and phone number into simple input fields and checks a consent box. After tapping “Submit,” an animated checkmark confirms submission and the quiz engine calculates the result tier. This happens quickly and without a full page reload.

Depending on the computed result, the app routes the user to one of three result pages. Ideal PRP candidates see a headline celebrating their “PRP Window,” a 30-second testimonial video matched to their persona, and an interactive month-by-month timeline of expected progress. Partial-fit users are invited to download a hair health guide and can schedule a scalp scan or upload photos for expert review. Users deemed not a current fit receive a link to download “5 Alternatives to PRP,” plus referral options to topical solutions or transplant providers.

All result pages end with a single, prominent call-to-action button. When clicked, it opens an embedded Wix Bookings iframe prefilled with the user’s name, email, phone, and quiz outcome tier. The scheduler displays available time slots in the user’s time zone and allows for an optional notes field. Once the user confirms a booking, an on-screen thank you message appears. Behind the scenes, a confirmation email containing quiz results and calendar invite is sent automatically, while PostHog logs the booking event, quiz outcome, and any video plays or guide downloads.

Administrators can edit quiz logic by navigating from the dashboard to the logic editor. In this editor, they update a JSON schema that defines question branching and result routing. Any media or copy changes are managed in the media library section. After saving edits, admins preview changes in a staging environment and then publish to production with a single click. The analytics panel updates in real time to reflect the new logic.

## Settings and Account Management
General quiz participants do not have account settings, but they can click a small footer link on any result page to unsubscribe from future communications or update their contact preferences by re-submitting their email on a dedicated preference page. This page simply asks for an email and offers checkboxes to opt in or out of email or SMS follow-ups.

Admins manage their own account details through a “My Profile” section in the dashboard. Here they can update their display name, email address, and password. There are no billing or subscription features in this app, so payment methods and invoices are not relevant. After adjusting any setting, admins click “Save” and receive an in-app confirmation message.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If a visitor types an invalid email or phone format on the data capture screen, the input fields highlight in red and a brief inline error message explains the requirement. Users cannot submit until corrections are made. Should network connectivity fail at any point, a banner appears at the top of the screen advising the user to check their connection. If the connection is restored, the quiz automatically resumes at the last completed step.

If the Wix Bookings iframe fails to load or the booking API returns an error, the CTA button triggers a fallback message: “Sorry, scheduling is temporarily unavailable. Please contact us at hello@summerviewmedical.com to book your session.” For admins, attempts to save malformed JSON in the logic editor produce a clear error dialog showing the validation issue. Admins can dismiss the dialog, correct the error, and retry saving without losing unsaved changes.

Unauthorized access to admin pages redirects users to the admin sign-in page with a message that login is required. Repeated failed login attempts trigger a timed lockout and prompt admins to use the password recovery flow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A visitor’s journey begins on the public landing page, where they discover a friendly 60-second quiz that feels more like a self-care tool than a medical form. They proceed through seven media-rich, interactive steps, submit minimal contact information, and immediately receive personalized feedback in one of three result tiers. From results, they seamlessly book a consultation via an embedded scheduler and receive confirmation via email. Throughout, PostHog tracks engagement at every stage. On the back end, administrators sign in to a dedicated dashboard to update quiz logic, swap media assets, and monitor analytics in real time. No matter how users enter the app, the flow is designed to feel empathetic, simple, and trustworthy, guiding each visitor from curiosity to consultation with minimal friction.
